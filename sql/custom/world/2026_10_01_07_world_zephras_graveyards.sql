-- Classic 1.60: graveyards of Zephras Isle (map 2991, zone 16593); without them a death there sent the player to the Barrens.
-- IDs from the official beta's cemetery list for the zone (ymir sniffs). Positions = where SMSG_DEATH_RELEASE_LOC sent the player
-- after dying on Zephras Isle (4 graveyards seen; the client has no graveyard positions). 11031 (starting village) and 11033 (Spirit
-- Healer) are certain; which of 10912 / 11032 is which of the other two spots is not in the data (the server only picks the nearest
-- graveyard, so it doesn't matter in game). The fifth ID in the list, 11432, has not been seen yet.
