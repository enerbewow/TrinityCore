# Forever Discord bot

One bot for the whole server. It does three things:

| Feature | What players see |
|---|---|
| **Server status** | A message whenever something goes up or down (`🟢 Roleplay realm is up`, `🔴 Auth server is down`), plus one status board message that is kept up to date: every realm with its player count, Alliance and Horde online, and how long it has been up (or since when it is down), plus the login server, the website and the database. `/status` shows the same board to whoever asks. |
| **Realm chat** | Each realm's General, Trade, LookingForGroup and LocalDefense chat in that realm's own Discord channel, with the faction: `[H] [General] <Thrall> hi guys`. |
| **Discord ↔ game** | Players are in an in-game **Discord** channel (`/leave Discord` to opt out, `/join Discord` to come back). Messages written in the realm's Discord chat channel appear there as `[Discord] [Name]: text` (plain text only: no images, embeds or reactions); what players type in it appears in Discord. |
| **LFG posts** | Every Group Finder listing becomes one post in the realm's LFG channel (e.g. `#lfg-normal`): the dungeon, the title and comment, and the members with level, class and roles (🛡️ tank, ➕ healer, 🗡️ damage). It is updated as people join or leave and removed when the group delists. |
| **`/register`** | A form for an e-mail and password. The bot creates the game account, which works on every realm. |

Also available: `/status`, which shows the status board to whoever asks (only they see it).

It runs on the same PC as the servers. You can start and stop it by hand or from the launcher's **Local server** tab.

## 1. How it works

```
 worldserver Normal   :8085  RA :3443  Chat.log ─┐
 worldserver PvP      :8095  RA :3444  logs_pvp\Chat.log ─┤
 worldserver Roleplay :8105  RA :3445  logs_rp\Chat.log ──┼──> forever_bot.py ──> Discord
 worldserver Hardcore :8115  RA :3446  logs_hc\Chat.log ──┤        ^
 bnetserver           :1119                              │        │ 127.0.0.1:8190
 support website      :443                               │     launcher (finds it, stops it with Ctrl+C)
 MySQL                :3307 ─────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Status:** every 10 seconds the bot tries to open a TCP connection to each port. A worldserver opens its port only once it has finished loading, so "up" means players can log in. "Down" is reported after 2 missed checks in a row, so a busy moment does not set it off.
- **Player counts and uptime** come from the console command `server info`, which the bot runs on each realm through Remote Access (RA) once a minute.
- **Alliance / Horde** counts come from each realm's characters database (online characters by race; Skyborne 95 is Alliance, 96 Horde), read at the same time. "Down since" is the time the bot saw the realm or service go down.
- **Chat:** TrinityCore's `chat_log` script writes every message in a system channel (General, Trade, LookingForGroup, LocalDefense, city channels) to the log. One logger line in `worldserver.conf` sends those lines to `Chat.log`. The bot reads new lines every second and posts them every 2 seconds, several lines per Discord message. Item links become `[Linen Cloth]`. `@everyone` and role pings typed in game are neutralised. Whispers, party, guild, say and player-made channels are **never** relayed.
- **`/register`** runs `bnetaccount create <email> <password>` through RA on the first realm that is up. Accounts live in the shared `auth` database, so the account works on every realm. The bot remembers which Discord user made which account (in `discord_bot_state.json`) and allows one account per Discord user by default.

---

## 2. Create the Discord bot

1. Open <https://discord.com/developers/applications> and click **New Application**. Name it, for example "Forever".
2. On the **Bot** page:
   - Click **Reset Token**, then **Copy**. This is the bot's password. It goes into `discord_bot.json` as `"token"`. Never post it anywhere. If it leaks, reset it here.
   - Turn **Public Bot** off, so only you can add it to servers.
   - Privileged gateway intents: leave Presence and Server Members off. Turn **Message Content** **on** only if you want Discord messages to reach the game (`chat.from_discord`); Discord hides message text from bots without it, and the bot then refuses to start with `from_discord` on and says so.
3. On the **OAuth2** page, copy the **Client ID**, then open this link with your client ID filled in:

   ```
   https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&scope=bot+applications.commands&permissions=84992
   ```

   Choose your Discord server and click **Authorize**. `84992` = View Channels + Send Messages + Embed Links + Read Message History, which is all the bot needs (the history lets it clean up its own old messages in the status channel). Already invited with the old link? Give its role **Read Message History** in the status channel instead of inviting again.
4. Make sure the bot's role can see and write in the channels you give it. This matters for private channels, such as a staff log channel.

Suggested Discord channels:

| Channel | Use |
|---|---|
| `#server-status` | up/down messages and the status board. Read-only for players. |
| `#normal-chat`, `#pvp-chat`, `#rp-chat`, `#hardcore-chat` | one per realm. Read-only for players. |
| `#create-account` | where `/register` may be used (optional). |
| `#account-log` | staff only: who created which account (optional). |

---

## 3. Find your server, channel and role IDs

1. In Discord: **User Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode** on.
2. Right-click your **server icon → Copy Server ID**. That is `guild_id`.
3. Right-click a **channel → Copy Channel ID**.
4. Right-click a **role** (Server Settings → Roles) **→ Copy Role ID**.

IDs are long numbers. Put them in the config **without** quotes, e.g. `"channel_id": 1234567890123456789`. `0` means "not used".

---

## 4. Install Python and discord.py

The bot needs **Python 3.10 or newer** and the `discord.py` package.

**On a PC with a normal Python install** (the development setup), in a command prompt:

```
"C:\Program Files\Python311\python.exe" -m pip install -r "F:\wow stuff\TrinityCore-forever\contrib\discord_bot\requirements.txt"
```

**In the server repack**, the website's Python (`web\python`) is the small "embeddable" Python. It has no `pip`, but it loads every package placed in its own folder (that is how `pymysql` got there). On any PC with Python **3.11** and pip, install discord.py into that folder:

```
py -3.11 -m pip install discord.py --target "C:\path\to\ForeverRepack\web\python" --only-binary=:all: --platform win_amd64 --python-version 3.11
```

Then copy `forever_bot.py` and your `discord_bot.json` to `ForeverRepack\discord_bot\`.

Check that it worked: `python -c "import discord; print(discord.__version__)"` prints a version such as `2.6.x`.

---

## 5. Turn on the worldserver side

Skip the parts you don't want. In **every** worldserver config (`worldserver.conf`, `worldserver_pvp.conf`, `worldserver_rp.conf`, `worldserver_hc.conf`):

```
# next to the other Appender.* lines
Appender.Chat=2,2,0,Chat.log,w
Appender.GroupFinder=2,3,0,GroupFinder.log,w

# next to the other Logger.* lines
Logger.chat.log.system=2,Chat
Logger.chat.log.channel.Discord=2,Chat
Logger.groupfinder=3,GroupFinder

# anywhere (the in-game Discord channel)
Discord.Channel.Enable = 1
Discord.Channel.Name = "Discord"
```

| Lines | For |
|---|---|
| `Appender.Chat` + `Logger.chat.log.system` | **Realm chat** to Discord: General, Trade, LookingForGroup, LocalDefense and city channels go to `Chat.log`. |
| `Logger.chat.log.channel.Discord` | What players type in the **in-game Discord channel** also goes to `Chat.log` (and from there to Discord). The last word is the channel name. |
| `Discord.Channel.Enable` / `Name` | The **in-game Discord channel**: every player joins it at login. `/leave Discord` turns that off for the character (remembered), `/join Discord` turns it on again. Discord messages appear in it as `[Discord] [Name]: text`. |
| `Appender.GroupFinder` + `Logger.groupfinder` | **Group Finder listings** to the LFG channels: every listing change goes to `GroupFinder.log`. |

- `Appender.X=2,2,0,X.log,w` = a file (2), log level, no prefix (0), recreated at each start (`w`). The files go into that realm's `LogsDir`: `Chat.log` / `GroupFinder.log` for Normal and `logs_pvp\`, `logs_rp\`, `logs_hc\` for the others in the development setup; `server\logs\`, `server\logs_pvp\`... in the repack.
- The Discord channel needs the worldserver from 2026-10-06 or newer (the `.discord say` command and the `character_discord_optout` table in each characters database: `sql/custom/characters/2026_10_06_00_characters_discord_optout.sql`).

Restart the worldservers. Then say something in General in game. A line like `Player Thrall (H) tells channel General - Durotar: hi` should appear in that realm's `Chat.log`.

> The development configs in `build\bin\RelWithDebInfo\` already have all of these lines (2026-10-06).

---

## 6. Write the config file

1. Copy `discord_bot.example.json` to `discord_bot.json` in the same folder. `discord_bot.json` is git-ignored because it holds your token.
2. Fill in:
   - `token`: from step 2.
   - `guild_id`: from step 3. With it, slash commands appear at once. Without it, they can take up to an hour.
   - `status.channel_id`: your status channel.
   - Each realm's `chat_channel_id`: that realm's chat channel.
   - Each realm's `chat_log`: path to that realm's `Chat.log`. A relative path starts from the folder of `discord_bot.json`.
   - Optional: `accounts.channel_id`, `accounts.log_channel_id`.
3. Check the realm and service names. They are exactly what Discord shows: `Normal realm`, `Roleplay realm`, `Auth server`...

The example file already has the right ports for this server (worlds 8085/8095/8105/8115, RA 3443–3446, bnet 1119, website 443, MySQL 3307). For the repack, set MySQL to **3317**, use `"chat_log": "../server/logs/Chat.log"` and so on, and set `"localservers": "../localservers.json"`.

Every key is explained in [§9](#9-config-reference).

---

## 7. The Remote Access account

Player counts and `/register` use the worldservers' Remote Access console (`Ra.Enable = 1` in each worldserver config, ports 3443–3446). The account needs GM level 3 on all realms (`RealmID -1`).

You normally need nothing new. The launcher already has such an account, the **console account** (`consoleUser` / `consolePassword` in `localservers.json`). The repack's `Setup.bat` creates it. The bot reads it from there:

```json
"ra": { "host": "127.0.0.1", "user": "", "password": "", "localservers": "%APPDATA%/ForeverLauncher/localservers.json" }
```

To give the bot its own account instead, create one in a worldserver console and put it in `ra.user` / `ra.password`. That value wins over `localservers`:

```
bnetaccount create discordbot@local SomeLongPassword
account set seclevel 4#1 3 -1       <- the game account name printed by the line above
```

Without an RA account, status and chat still work. Player counts are left out, and `/register` answers "not available".

---

## 8. Run it

### By hand

```
cd "F:\wow stuff\TrinityCore-forever\contrib\discord_bot"
"C:\Program Files\Python311\python.exe" forever_bot.py
```

or with a config file somewhere else: `python forever_bot.py D:\path\discord_bot.json`.

It prints `logged in as Forever#1234`, the slash commands it registered, and the chat channels it relays. Stop it with **Ctrl+C**. Before it exits, it posts which services went down and marks the status board "Status bot offline".

### From the launcher

Add three lines to your server's block in `localservers.json`: `%APPDATA%\ForeverLauncher\localservers.json`, or the one next to the repack's `ForeverLauncher.exe`. They go next to `webExe` / `webArgs` / `webPort`:

```json
"botExe": "C:\\Program Files\\Python311\\python.exe",
"botArgs": "\"F:\\wow stuff\\TrinityCore-forever\\contrib\\discord_bot\\forever_bot.py\"",
"botPort": 8190
```

Repack version:

```json
"botExe": "{here}\\web\\python\\python.exe",
"botArgs": "\"{here}\\discord_bot\\forever_bot.py\"",
"botPort": 8190
```

Restart the launcher. The **Local server** tab then shows a **Discord bot** row with Start / Stop:

- **Start all** starts the bot **first**, so it reports MySQL, login, every realm and the website as they come up.
- **Stop all** stops it **last**, so it can report everything going down.
- The launcher recognises the running bot by `botPort`. That must be the same number as `control_port` in `discord_bot.json` (default 8190). This port only answers on 127.0.0.1. It also stops a second copy of the bot from starting.

### What users do

- `/status`: the status board, visible only to the person who asked.
- `/register`: opens a form with **E-mail**, **Password** and **Password again**. Only the person filling it in sees the form and the answer. The e-mail is the login name, so it doesn't have to be a real address, but it must look like one (`name@example.com`). The password must be 8–16 characters (configurable): letters, digits and symbols, no spaces or quotes.

## 9. Config reference

### Top level

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `server_name` | `Forever` | Used in the status board title ("Forever server status"). |
| `token` | – | Bot token (step 2). **Required.** |
| `guild_id` | `0` | Your Discord server ID. With it, slash commands appear at once; with 0 they are global (up to an hour). |
| `control_port` | `8190` | Local port the launcher uses to find the bot. Same number as the launcher's `botPort`. `0` = none. |
| `state_file` | `discord_bot_state.json` | Where the bot keeps the status board message ID and who registered which account. |

### `status`

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `channel_id` | `0` | Channel for up/down messages. |
| `board` | `true` | Keep one status board message up to date. |
| `board_channel_id` | = `channel_id` | Channel for the board. Use a separate read-only channel if the up/down messages push it out of sight. Deleting the board message is fine: the bot posts a new one. |
| `interval_seconds` | `10` | Time between checks (minimum 5). |
| `timeout_seconds` | `3` | How long a check waits for a connection. |
| `fails_before_down` | `2` | Missed checks in a row before something counts as down. Coming up is reported at once. |
| `players_interval_seconds` | `60` | How often player counts, uptime (over RA) and Alliance / Horde counts (database) are read. `0` = never. |
| `mention_role_id` | `0` | A role pinged when something goes **down** (e.g. `@Staff`). The role must be "mentionable", or the bot needs the Mention @everyone permission. |
| `announce` | `true` | Post up/down messages at all. With `false`, only the board changes. |
| `announce_on_start` | `false` | Also post the state found when the bot starts. Normally the bot starts before the servers, so it reports them coming up anyway. |
| `up_text` / `down_text` | `🟢 **{name}** is up` / `🔴 **{name}** is down` | Message text. `{name}` = the realm or service name. |
| `title` | `<server_name> server status` | Board title. |
| `tidy` | `true` | Keep the status channel clean: when a new up/down message is posted, the older ones are deleted. At start the bot also removes its own old messages there (needs **Read Message History** in that channel). The status board and messages of people are never deleted. |
| `keep_messages` | `1` | How many of the newest up/down messages stay. `0` = none (only the board). |

### `realms` (one entry per worldserver)

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `name` | Shown in Discord: `Normal realm`, `PvP realm`, `Roleplay realm`, `Hardcore realm`. |
| `host`, `port` | The worldserver's `WorldServerPort` (8085, 8095, 8105, 8115). |
| `ra_port` | The worldserver's `Ra.Port` (3443–3446). Used for player counts, uptime and `/register`. |
| `characters_db` | The realm's characters database (`characters`, `characters_pvp`, `characters_rp`, `characters_hc`). Used for the Alliance / Horde counts, with the login from `db`. Leave it out for no faction counts. |
| `chat_log` | Path to that realm's `Chat.log` (step 5). Leave it out for no chat relay. |
| `chat_channel_id` | Discord channel for that realm's chat. `0` = no chat relay. Several realms may share a channel; then add `{realm}` to `chat.format`. With `chat.from_discord` on, messages written in this channel go to the realm's in-game Discord channel. |
| `lfg_log` | Path to that realm's `GroupFinder.log` (step 5). |
| `lfg_channel_id` | Discord channel for that realm's Group Finder listings (e.g. `#lfg-normal`). `0` = no LFG posts for this realm. Best read-only for players: the bot keeps it tidy itself. |

### `services` (anything else to watch)

A list of `{ "name": "...", "host": "...", "port": N }`. The example has Auth server (1119), Support website (443) and Database (3307). Remove the ones you don't want, or add more, e.g. the bnet REST login `8081`.

**Show or hide** (realms and services alike): add `"show": false` to leave an entry off the status board and `/status`, and `"announce": false` to post no up/down messages for it. Both default to `true`. Example: `{ "name": "Database", "host": "127.0.0.1", "port": 3307, "show": false }` keeps the database off the public board but still posts when it goes down.

### `chat`

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `channels` | General, Trade, LookingForGroup, LocalDefense | Which in-game channels to relay, and the label each gets in Discord: `{"General": "General", "LookingForGroup": "LFG"}` shows `[LFG]`. An empty `{}` relays every system channel. |
| `format` | `{faction}[{channel}] <{player}> {message}` | Line format. Placeholders: `{faction}` (`[A] ` or `[H] `), `{channel}`, `{player}`, `{message}`, `{zone}` (e.g. Durotar for General; empty for LFG), `{realm}`. Example: `**[{channel}]** <{player}> {message}`. |
| `from_discord` | `false` | Discord to game: messages in a realm's `chat_channel_id` go to its in-game Discord channel (`.discord say` over RA). Needs the Message Content intent (step 2) and `Discord.Channel.Enable = 1` (step 5). Text only: attachments, embeds, stickers and reactions are dropped, mentions become names, line breaks become spaces, `|` becomes `/`, the server cuts it to 255 characters. Messages of bots (this one included) are ignored, so nothing echoes. |
| `poll_seconds` | `1` | How often the logs are read. |
| `flush_seconds` | `2` | How often waiting lines are posted. Lines are grouped, which keeps Discord's rate limits happy in a busy Trade chat. |

### `db` (optional: Alliance / Horde counts)

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `host`, `port` | `127.0.0.1`, `3306` | The MySQL server with the characters databases: 3307 in the development setup, 3317 in the repack. |
| `user`, `password` | – | A MySQL login that can read the characters databases: the same one the worldservers use (`CharacterDatabaseInfo` in `worldserver.conf`, `trinity` / `trinity` by default). |

Without a `db` section the board leaves the faction line out. Needs the `pymysql` package (in `requirements.txt`; the repack's Python already has it).

### `ra`

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `host` | `127.0.0.1` | Where the worldservers' RA listens. |
| `user`, `password` | empty | Account for RA (see [§7](#7-the-remote-access-account)). Empty = take it from `localservers`. |
| `localservers` | – | Path to the launcher's `localservers.json`, which holds the console account. `%APPDATA%` and other variables are expanded; a relative path starts from the config's folder. |

### `accounts` (`/register`)

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `true` | `false` = no `/register` command. |
| `channel_id` | `0` | Only allow `/register` in this channel. `0` = anywhere. |
| `required_role_id` | `0` | Only members with this role (e.g. "Verified") may register. |
| `log_channel_id` | `0` | Staff channel where each new account is logged with the Discord user. Passwords are never logged. |
| `max_per_user` | `1` | Accounts per Discord user. `0` = no limit. |
| `min_discord_account_age_days` | `7` | Discord accounts younger than this can't register (stops throw-away accounts). |
| `cooldown_seconds` | `300` | Wait between two attempts by the same user. Typos in the form don't start the wait. |
| `password_min_length` / `password_max_length` | `8` / `16` | Allowed password length (max 128; the game account part is cut to 16 by the server, so 16 keeps it simple). |
| `success_text` | `Log in to the launcher with **{email}** …` | Shown after a successful registration. `{email}` = the new login. |

To let someone register again (they forgot the e-mail, or you deleted their account), stop the bot, remove their entry from `"accounts"` in `discord_bot_state.json`, and start it again.

---

## 10. Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| `Discord rejected the bot token` | Copy the token again (Developer Portal → Bot → Reset Token). Paste it without spaces. |
| `port 8190 is in use: is the bot already running?` | A copy is already running (look for its console window, or stop it in the launcher). Or another program uses the port: change `control_port` **and** the launcher's `botPort`. |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'discord'` | Step 4 was done with a different Python than the one that runs the bot. Install it with the same `python.exe` that's in `botExe`. |
| Slash commands don't show up | Set `guild_id`. Invite the bot with the link from step 2: it needs the `applications.commands` scope. Restart Discord (Ctrl+R). |
| Status messages don't appear | Check `status.channel_id`, and that the bot can see and write in that channel. The bot's console prints a warning for channels it can't use. |
| A realm shows down although it runs | The `port` must be that worldserver's `WorldServerPort`. A worldserver still loading counts as down until it opens its port. |
| No chat in Discord | 1) Is there a `Chat.log` in that realm's log folder, and does it grow when you talk in General? If not, see step 5 and restart that worldserver. 2) Check `chat_log` path and `chat_channel_id`. 3) Only General, Trade, LookingForGroup and LocalDefense are relayed by default (`chat.channels`). Player-made channels never are. |
| No player counts | The bot has no working RA account (console shows `RA login failed`): see [§7](#7-the-remote-access-account). |
| `/register` says "not available right now" | No RA account configured (§7). |
| `/register` says the servers are offline | No realm's RA port answered: at least one worldserver must run. |
| `/register` says "could not be created" | The console window shows the server's answer. Usually the RA account lacks the `bnetaccount create` permission: it needs GM level 3 on realm `-1`. |
| Launcher's Stop kills the bot instead of stopping it | It gets 20 seconds after Ctrl+C. If Discord is unreachable at that moment, the last status post can take longer. Nothing is lost except that last post. |

The bot's console (or the launcher-started console window, minimized) prints every status change, every account created, and every error with details.

---

## 11. Security notes

- The **token** controls your bot. Keep `discord_bot.json` private (it is git-ignored). If the token leaks, reset it in the Developer Portal.
- `/register` passwords go from Discord to the bot, then over a local RA connection (127.0.0.1) to the worldserver. They are **not** stored or logged by the bot. The Discord form doesn't hide the characters while typing, but only the person filling it in can see it.
- The e-mail and password are checked (letters, digits and symbols only; no spaces or quotes) before they are sent to the console, so nobody can slip a second console command in.
- In-game chat is shown as plain text in Discord: markdown is escaped, and `@everyone`, `@here`, user and role pings can't trigger.
- Up/down checks are plain TCP connects from this PC. With network logging at trace level (`Logger.network=1`), worldservers log those connections. Set it to 3 if the extra lines bother you.
